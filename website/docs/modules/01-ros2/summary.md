# Module 1 Summary: ROS 2 - Robotic Nervous System

## Key Concepts Covered

In this module, you've learned about ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system, covering:

- The fundamental architecture of ROS 2 and its role in humanoid robotics
- Core communication patterns including topics, services, and actions
- Node management and the ROS 2 graph
- Package structure and development workflow
- Best practices for building robust robotic systems

## Practical Applications

You've implemented:

- Basic publisher and subscriber nodes
- Service clients and servers
- Action clients and servers
- Parameter management and configuration
- Logging and debugging techniques

## Integration Points

ROS 2 serves as the foundation for:

- Sensor data distribution
- Control command propagation
- AI system communication
- Simulation integration
- Hardware abstraction layers

## Next Steps

With the ROS 2 foundation established, you're now ready to explore:

- Simulation environments in Module 2
- AI integration in Module 3
- Perception-action systems in Module 4

Continue to the [next module](../02-gazebo-unity/intro.md) to learn about digital twins and simulation environments.
