# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Bridging Digital and Physical Intelligence

Welcome to the comprehensive technical book on building AI systems for humanoid robots. This book bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical intelligence, providing a complete guide to creating embodied AI systems.

## About This Book

This book is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in humanoid robotics. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a cohesive learning path for developing sophisticated robotic systems.

### Course Structure

The book is organized into four core modules:

- **Module 1: ROS 2 – Robotic Nervous System** - Learn how to build the communication infrastructure for humanoid robots
- **Module 2: Gazebo & Unity – Digital Twins** - Master simulation environments for testing and development
- **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac – AI Robot Brain** - Implement advanced AI capabilities for robotic systems
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Create integrated perception-action systems

## Getting Started

If you're new to humanoid robotics, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started](./getting-started/installation.md) guide to set up your development environment. If you're already familiar with the basics, you can jump directly to the module that interests you most.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Robotics engineers and researchers
- AI/ML practitioners interested in embodied systems
- Students studying robotics and AI
- Developers building robotic applications
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and physical systems

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## How to Use This Book

Each module contains:
- Theoretical foundations and concepts
- Practical implementation guides
- Code examples and best practices
- Exercises and challenges
- Integration with AI assistants for personalized learning
