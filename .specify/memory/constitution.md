# Constitution of the Unified Spec‑Driven Book Project

## 1. Purpose and Vision

This document defines the **constitution** of the project: the non‑negotiable principles, architectural rules, roles, workflows, and quality bars that govern how the unified book, AI systems, and infrastructure are designed, implemented, and evaluated.

The project's mission is to **bridge digital intelligence and physical intelligence** by producing:

* A **spec‑driven technical book** on *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics*
* A **deeply integrated AI assistant** that understands, personalizes, and translates the book
* A **reusable intelligence system** built with Claude Code, Spec‑Kit Plus, agents, subagents, and skills

This constitution ensures consistency, reproducibility, and extensibility across all contributors and automated agents.

## 2. Governing Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

### 2.1 Spec‑First Development

* **No implementation without spec**: Every feature starts with a complete specification
* **Markdown / MDX** – content format
* **GitHub Pages** – deployment target

### 3.2 Spec & Intelligence Layer

* **Spec‑Kit Plus** – requirements, contracts, and specs
* **Claude Code** – implementation, refactoring, and agent orchestration
* **Claude Agent Skills** – reusable capabilities
* **Claude Subagents** – specialized autonomous roles

### 3.3 AI & Backend Systems

* **FastAPI** – backend API
* **OpenAI Agents / ChatKit SDKs** – conversational orchestration
* **Neon Serverless Postgres** – structured data & auth profiles
* **Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier)** – vector storage

### 3.4 Authentication & Personalization

* **Better‑Auth** – signup/signin
* Profile‑driven personalization engine

---

## 4. System Architecture (Authoritative)

### 4.1 High‑Level Layers

1. **Specification Layer**
   Specs define chapters, agents, APIs, personalization rules, and UI behaviors

2. **Content Layer**
   Docusaurus book generated and maintained by Claude Code via specs

3. **Intelligence Layer**
   Claude agents, subagents, and skills executing reusable cognition

4. **Retrieval Layer**
   RAG pipelines powered by Qdrant + structured metadata

5. **Interaction Layer**
   Embedded chatbot, chapter buttons, personalization UI

---

## 5. Book Constitution

### 5.1 Book Structure Rules

* Each **Module = One Docusaurus Section**
* Each **Week = One Chapter**
* Each chapter must include:

  * Learning objectives
  * Conceptual explanation
  * Practical exercises
  * Agent‑generated summaries

### 5.2 Immutable Course Scope

**Course Title:** Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
**Theme:** Embodied Intelligence in the Physical World

Modules:

1. ROS 2 – Robotic Nervous System
2. Gazebo & Unity – Digital Twins
3. NVIDIA Isaac – AI Robot Brain
4. Vision‑Language‑Action (VLA)

---

## 6. RAG Chatbot Constitution

### 6.1 Core Capabilities (Mandatory)

* Answer questions about **entire book content**
* Answer questions based on **user‑selected text only**
* Cite retrieved sections internally (hidden from UI)

### 6.2 Behavioral Constraints

* No hallucinations beyond retrieved chunks
* If context is missing → respond with clarification request

### 6.3 RAG Data Model

* Chunked by:

  * Chapter
  * Section
  * Concept type (theory, code, hardware, warning)

---

## 7. Agent System Constitution

### 7.1 Core Claude Roles

**Master Spec Agent**
Owns specs, validates consistency, rejects violations

**Book Author Agent**
Generates and refines chapters from specs

**RAG Engineer Agent**
Manages embeddings, retrieval quality, and grounding

**Personalization Agent**
Adapts content to user background

**Translation Agent (Urdu)**
Faithful technical translation with preserved meaning

---

## 8. Subagents & Skills (Bonus Intelligence)

### 8.1 Subagents

* ROS Explainer Agent
* Hardware Advisor Agent
* Sim‑to‑Real Risk Analyzer
* Capstone Project Mentor

### 8.2 Agent Skills

* Spec → Markdown generation
* Chapter refactoring
* User background inference
* Safety & hardware constraint checking

All subagents must:

* Be stateless or explicitly scoped
* Declare inputs/outputs in specs

---

## 9. Authentication & User Modeling

### 9.1 Signup Questions (Mandatory)

* Programming experience
* Robotics experience
* Hardware access (GPU, Jetson, Robot)
* Preferred language

### 9.2 User Profile Usage

* Adjust depth of explanations
* Recommend hardware paths
* Control personalization & translation

---

## 10. Personalization Rules

* Personalization is **opt‑in** per chapter
* Activated via button at chapter start
* Content variants must remain technically correct
* No dilution of core concepts

---

## 11. Translation Constitution (Urdu)

* Triggered per chapter via UI button
* Technical terms preserved or parenthesized
* No cultural reinterpretation
* Meaning > literal translation

---

## 12. Hardware & Lab Governance

### 12.1 Accepted Models

* On‑Prem RTX Workstations
* Cloud GPU (AWS g5 / g6e)
* Jetson Orin Edge Kits

### 12.2 Latency Rule

* **Never control physical robots directly from cloud**
* Cloud = training, Local = inference

---

## 13. Evaluation & Scoring Framework

* Base Functionality: **100 points**
* Claude Subagents & Skills: **+50**
* Auth & Personalization: **+50**
* Chapter Personalization Button: **+50**
* Urdu Translation Button: **+50**

---

## 14. Change Management

* Constitution changes require:

  * Updated spec
  * Agent validation
  * Explicit version bump

---

## 15. Final Authority

If ambiguity arises:

1. Constitution
2. Specs (Spec‑Kit Plus)
3. Automated Agent Validation
4. Human Review

This constitution is binding for all humans and machines participating in the project.
